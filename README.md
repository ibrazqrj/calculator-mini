<b>📋 Description</b>
---
Embark on a personal learning journey with this Java project, meticulously crafted to master the art of building a calculator that interacts with the user through dialog boxes. Designed as a self-paced endeavor, this project prompts users to input two numbers and select an operator (*, +, -, /) to perform a corresponding calculation. Let's delve into the essence of this independent exploration:


<b>📊 User-Driven Calculations</b>
---
The program prompts the user to input two numbers and select an operator to perform a calculation.


<b>💡 Learning Journey</b>
---
This project is a testament to personal initiative, undertaken to enhance programming skills and deepen understanding of Java fundamentals. By implementing a functional calculator, crucial concepts such as methods, loops, and conditional statements are applied and understood in practice.


<b>🚀 How It Works</b>
---
Input: Users are prompted to enter the first and second numbers, as well as the operator.
Calculation: The program executes the corresponding calculation based on the operator and displays the result.
Interaction: User interaction is facilitated through JOptionPane dialog boxes, providing a simple and user-friendly input experience.
